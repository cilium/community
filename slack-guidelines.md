# üåê Cilium and eBPF Community Slack Guidelines

Welcome to the Cilium and eBPF Slack! This is a space for users, contributors, and maintainers to collaborate, ask questions, and share ideas around **Cilium**, **Hubble**, **Tetragon**, and the broader **eBPF ecosystem**.

To keep our community welcoming and productive, we ask that you follow these guidelines. If you have any questions about them, please reach out to the [Cilium community team](https://github.com/cilium/community/blob/main/CONTRIBUTOR-ROLES.md#community-team).

## üìú Code of Conduct

All Slack activity is governed by the [CNCF Code of Conduct](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/main/code-of-conduct.md). Be respectful, inclusive, and considerate in your communication.

If you experience or witness behavior that violates the Code of Conduct, please reach out to a maintainer or email <conduct@cncf.io>.

## Slack Best Practices

- **Be Respectful and Inclusive**: Follow the CNCF Code of Conduct in all interactions.
- **Use Threads**: Keep discussions organized by replying in threads.
- **Stick to the Channel Topic**: Post in the most relevant channel and stay on topic.
- **No Cross-Posting**: Don‚Äôt repeat the same question in multiple channels.
- **Don't DM about technical questions without permission**: Always ask before sending a direct message or ask in public so everyone can learn.
- **No Spam or Promotions**: Commercial or promotional content is not allowed, unless explicitly permitted in a specific channel.
- **Keep Company Business Elsewhere**: Use your company‚Äôs own tools for proprietary or internal discussions.
- **Jobs & Resumes:** `#careers` Nowhere else.
