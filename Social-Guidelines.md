This document highlights the social media guidelines for the use of the Cilium
project's Twitter/X, LinkedIn and other social media channels that belong to the
Cilium project.

These guidelines apply to all the Cilium project social media channels, regardless of who manages them.

## Objectives

The objectives of managing the Cilium project's social channels is to:

- Share project news, roadmap updates, news releases, and user stories

This guide will help you effectively manage the channels while incorporating the unique character of the project.

## Channel Selection

- **Twitter:** Use this platform to share news, events, and updates, and engage in conversations with the community.
- **LinkedIn:** Focus on professional discussions, project highlights, events promotion, and industry trends.

## Strategy

- Share content across social media channels that benefit the project as a whole.
- Infuse tweets with the bee emoji üêù to create a sense of fun, identity, and community.
- Share vendor-neutral, community-sourced posts that are informational, engaging, and ecosystem-focused.
- Content is to be vendor-neutral and project-positive sourced from contributors, maintainers, news outlets, etc., including blog posts, news coverage, thought leadership bylines, technology demos, sketch notes, GitHub work, Cilium or eBPF-specific Meetups, etc.

## Guidelines

For all Cilium social activity, we remain a neutral project, independent of any company.

- Maintain a professional yet friendly and fun tone in all interactions.
- Adhere to the project's code of conduct and respect user privacy and security.
- Engage with the community through retweets and sharing of community content.
- Cilium is not able to share anything on our channels that promotes a vendor product.
- Activities that are hosted by and open to the public can be promoted, as they benefit the ecosystem as a whole.
- RTs are limited to news outlet handles, project handles, and personal handles.
- Attribution can be given to authors of external content (such as tweets, images, videos, etc.), but it is not strictly required.
- Thank users for their support and contributions to the project.
- When posting about events coming up that are relevant to the Cilium project or new blogs, case studies, or other project content, please make sure to post on both Twitter and Linkedin.
