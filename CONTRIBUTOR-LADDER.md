## Contributor Ladder

Hello! We are excited that you want to learn more about our project contributor ladder! This contributor ladder outlines the different contributor roles within the Cilium project, along with the responsibilities and privileges that come with them. Community members generally start at the first levels of the "ladder" and advance up it as their involvement in the project grows. Our contributors are happy to help you advance along the contributor ladder.

Each of the contributor roles below is organized into lists of three types of things. "Requirements" are things that a contributor is expected to do at that level. "Qualifications" are qualifications a person needs to meet to be at that level (may be one or any/all of them), and "Privileges" are things contributors on that level are entitled to.

As the Cilium project grows, the current roles may be broken out into new roles and/or teams and roles may no longer be needed. 

The final judgment on whether an individual fulfills the criteria for a role is up to the Cilium Committers. After six months of inactivity or after any behavior detrimental to the future of the project, any contributor can be removed from their position(s).

### Community Contributor

Becoming a Community Contributor is the first step towards becoming an Organization Member.

### Organization Member
Description: An Organization Member is an established contributor who regularly participates in the project. Organization Members have privileges in project repositories and as such are expected to act in the interests of the whole project. Organization Members can take on [additional roles within the project](CONTRIBUTOR-ROLES.md) and can work more independently, for example triggering CI. 

An Organization Member has all the rights and responsibilities of a Community Contributor, plus:

* Responsibilities:
    * Continues to contribute regularly
    * Work to accomplish the tasks they volunteer to do within the project

* Qualifications:
    * Must have successful contributions to the project, including at least one of the following:
        * Written and/or reviewed PRs,
        * Reviewed PRs,
        * Made contributions that resolved Issues,
        * Or some equivalent combination or contribution
    * Must be actively contributing to at least one project area, where the privileges of Organization Member will be beneficial

* Privileges:
    * Can trigger CI
    * Can leave reviews on PRs
    * Can recommend other contributors to become Cilium Github Org Members
    * Can nominate themselves to [other roles within Cilium](CONTRIBUTOR-ROLES.md)

The process for a Contributor to become an Organization Member is as follows:

1. Open a PR in the member management file
2. Receive two "LGTM" comments from any Org Members, and approval by a committer who merges the PR

### Reviewer
Description: A Reviewer has responsibility for specific code, documentation, test, or other project areas. They are collectively responsible, with other Reviewers, for reviewing all changes to those areas and indicating whether those changes are ready to merge. They have a track record of contribution and review in the project.

Reviewers are responsible for a "specific area." This can be a specific code directory, chapter of the docs, or other clearly-defined project component that is smaller than an entire repository or subproject. Most often it is one or a set of directories in one or more Git repositories. The "specific area" below refers to this area of responsibility.
Reviewers have all the rights and responsibilities of an Organization Member, plus:

* Responsibilities:
    * Following the [reviewing guide](https://docs.cilium.io/en/stable/contributing/development/contributing_guide/#pull-requests-review-process-for-committers) 
    * Regularly reviewing Pull Requests against their specific areas of responsibility, including Pull Requests that are assigned to them
    * Helping other contributors become reviewers
    * Review CFPs and provide feedback

* Requirements:
    * Is an Organization Member
    * Has a track record of constructive and valuable reviews
    * Has demonstrated an in-depth knowledge of the specific area, for example by resolving test failures or through contributions
    * Commits to being responsible for that specific area
    * Is supportive of new and occasional contributors and helps get useful PRs in shape to commit

* Privileges:
    * Has GitHub rights to approve pull requests in specific directories
    * Can recommend and review other Org Members to become Reviewers

The process for an Organization Member to become a Reviewer is as follows:

1. Open a PR in the member management file for at least two teams: "Reviewers" and for a specific review area
2. At least two members who are already Committers, approve the PR

Automated tooling assigns PRs across the Reviewers defined for each particular area. 

### Committer
Description: Committers have write privileges and voting privileges, and are collectively responsible for steering the project in a positive direction. As such it represents a significant level of trust in an individual's commitment to working with other committers and the community at large for the benefit of the project. 

Committers have all the rights and responsibilities of a Reviewer, plus:

* Responsibilities:
    * Mentoring new Committers
    * Discussing strategy and policy for the project
    * [Voting](https://docs.cilium.io/en/latest/community/governance/commit_access/#voting) on project matters when required
