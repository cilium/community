# CiliumCon

CiliumCon is organized with the help of the CNCF as a KubeCon co-located event,
so that dictates most of the process. This document describes how
Cilium community members can get involved to assist as co-chairs and program committee
members. The CNCF defines most of the requirements and responsibilities of these
roles, and this document clarifies how those roles are assigned within the
Cilium community.

## Roles

### Applying to hold CiliumCon

The [Cilium Community
Team](https://github.com/cilium/community/blob/main/CONTRIBUTOR-ROLES.md#community-team)
take responsibility for completing the CNCF's application form for holding
co-located events. (This form is sent out to all CNCF maintainers.)

### Program Co-chairs

Program co-chairs work with the CNCF to select the program committee, and
to put together the schedule for the event. While CNCF staff take care of the
logistics, CiliumCon program co-chairs have responsibility for the content and
are expected to take an active role in ensuring the overall success of the event.

* Qualifications
  * [Committer](https://github.com/cilium/community/blob/main/CONTRIBUTOR-LADDER.md#committer)
    in the Cilium organization
  * Experience of participating in and/or reviewing talks for similar conferences is preferred
  * The two co-chairs must be from different companies/organizations
  * Co-chairs may remain in role for up to three consecutive CiliumCon events (preferably
    two, but allowing for three ensures we can have continuity as described in
    the next bullet)
  * Where possible, there should be at least one co-chair who has fulfilled the
    role on a previous occasion, so that learnings from previous events are
    carried forward

* Responsibilities
  * Encouraging volunteers from the Cilium community to apply to be program
    committee members
  * Selecting the program committee from applications
  * Writing the CFP brief which describes the overall program and the types of
    submissions the program committee is looking for
  * Encouraging CFP submissions from across the community
  * Answering queries from the program committee
  * Answering CNCF staff queries and ensuring logistics are in place (for
    example, making sure the Code of Conduct is clearly linked in the Slack
    channel)
  * Building a balanced program schedule based on the feedback from the program
    committee and within the CNCF guidelines. The program co-chairs have final
    discretion on the schedule (for example, they can choose to reject a highly
    rated talk to avoid duplicate or very similar content)
  
* Process
  * The selection of program co-chairs is done through discussion in the private
    Cilium Committers' Slack channel, preferably by consensus (but using our
    standard
    [voting](https://github.com/cilium/community/blob/main/GOVERNANCE.md#voting)
    process if necessary) 

### CiliumCon Hosts

By default the program co-chairs also host CiliumCon on the day, but they could
choose to ask another member of the Cilium community to take this on if they
prefer.

* Qualifications
  * Comfortable to speak on stage and to facilitate audience Q&A

* Responsibilities
  * Building slides for welcome and closing remarks
  * Introducing speakers and facilitating audience Q&A
  * Time management, keeping the event on schedule, in co-ordination with CNCF
    staff/volunteers
  * Playing an active role in ensuring the event is successful on the day

* Process
  * If one or both the co-chairs don't want to take the hosting role, it is at
    their discretion who they approach to take on this role. Both co-chairs
    should agree on the selected host(s)

### Program Committee members

Anyone with an interest in Cilium can apply to be a program committee member.
The CNCF staff manage the application process and work with the program
co-chairs to build the committee. The CNCF manage limits on how many PC members
can come from a single organization (in 2023 it was two, and co-chairs do not
count against this limit unless they also rank talk submissions.)

* Responsibilities
  * Rating CFP submissions and providing feedback, according to CNCF-provided guidelines
