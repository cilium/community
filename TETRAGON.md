# Tetragon Governance

Tetragon, [as a core sub-project within Cilium](REPOSITORIES.md), follows the [Governance](GOVERNANCE.md) and [Contributor Ladder](CONTRIBUTOR-LADDER.md).

## Tetragon Contributor Ladder

The following [Contributor Ladder](CONTRIBUTOR-LADDER.md) roles apply without any modification to the Tetragon project:

* *Community Contributor*
* *Organization Member*
* *Reviewer*

In addition to these roles, the Tetragon project adds the “Tetragon Committer” role that is placed between the role of *Reviewer* and *Committer*. Tetragon Committers are similar to *Committers* (as specified in the [Contributor Ladder](CONTRIBUTOR-LADDER.md)) but only within the scope of the Tetragon project. More precisely, their scope of responsibilities, qualifications, and privileges are equivalent to *Committers* but only applicable within the scope of the Tetragon project. Note that a Tetragon Committer is not granted the status of Cilium “maintainer” in CNCF parlance.

### Tetragon Committer

Tetragon Committers have write, merge, and voting privileges, and are collectively responsible for steering the Tetragon project in a positive direction. As such it represents a significant level of trust in an individual's commitment to working with other Tetragon Committers and the community at large for the benefit of the Tetragon project.

Tetragon Committers have all the rights and responsibilities of a Reviewer, plus:

* Responsibilities:
  * Mentoring new Tetragon Committers
  * Discussing strategy and policy for the project
  * Voting on Tetragon project matters when required
  * Additional responsibilities specific to any project roles they may have
  * Approve contributors to assume roles
* Qualifications:
  * Laid out in granting commit access
  * Is supportive of new and occasional contributors and helps get useful PRs in shape to commit
  * Is able to exercise judgment for the good of the Tetragon project, independent of their employer, friends, or team
  * Mentors other contributors
* Privileges:
  * Can merge code into the Tetragon repository
  * Represent the project in public as a Tetragon Committer
  * Can nominate new Tetragon Committers
  * Is listed as a Tetragon Committer in Tetragon’s MAINTAINERS.md

Tetragon Committers who are contributing and maintaining project code are automatically part of the Code Team defined in [CONTRIBUTOR-ROLES.md](CONTRIBUTOR-ROLES.md).

Granting and Revoking Tetragon Committer access falls under the same rules as the “Cilium committer grant/revocation policy” specified in [Governance](GOVERNANCE.md). Discussions happen in `#tetragon-committers` instead of `#committers.`
