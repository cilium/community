# Cilium Contributors

These are the wonderful people who have donated their time and effort to help
make Cilium better for all of us to use. We wouldn't be where we are today
without your contributions. Thank you! ðŸ’–

All code contributors can be found in the [Authors file](https://github.com/cilium/cilium/blob/main/AUTHORS).
New non-code contributors should add their name to the bottom of this list on their first
community contribution, like writing a blog, giving a talk, or organizing a meetup. 
Please either submit a pull request adding your name, or mention it to another organization member
and we will add you. Use the commit message or PR description to briefly describe or link to your work. **All** contributors belong here. ðŸ’¯
